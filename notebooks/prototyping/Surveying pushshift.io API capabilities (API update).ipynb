       "      <td>&amp;gt; cynicism \\n\\nDo you expect me to have optimism? Tell me. Name a war where civilians have not been affected. It is not excuse, it is not cynicism it is fact. War does not care whether you are innocent or complicit. Meek men do not make good soldiers. Hard men, violent men, imperfect men do. Under what circumstances do you expect them to abide by the 'rules' of war when they see the very worst actions mankind has to offer? I'd be pretty fucked off if I was in their shoes too.\\n\\nAgain. The only way to avoid breaking the rules of war is to not start a war. This is a fact. The instigator creates the condition and the opportunity for civilian casualties. They and they alone are responsible.\\n\\nIn summary. Shit happens in war and I'd rather it happen to Russians in this instance. Fuck em.</td>\n",

With the swedish navy, a chokepoint can be made between helsinki and tallin which prevents russian ships from sailing between st petersburg and kaliningrad. And with the baltic sea closed off of russians the baltic states can still be supplied, armed and supported from the sea even if the russians manage to close the suvalki gap, not to even mention the amount of pressure that is taken off of baltic state's shoulders when russia has to monitor 1300km of new border with nato-finland.

       "1400  &gt; cynicism \\n\\nDo you expect me to have optimism? Tell me. Name a war where civilians have not been affected. It is not excuse, it is not cynicism it is fact. War does not care whether you are innocent or complicit. Meek men do not make good soldiers. Hard men, violent men, imperfect men do. Under what circumstances do you expect them to abide by the 'rules' of war when they see the very worst actions mankind has to offer? I'd be pretty fucked off if I was in their shoes too.\\n\\nAgain. The only way to avoid breaking the rules of war is to not start a war. This is a fact. The instigator creates the condition and the opportunity for civilian casualties. They and they alone are responsible.\\n\\nIn summary. Shit happens in war and I'd rather it happen to Russians in this instance. Fuck em.  \n",
