    "The purpose of this document is to positively determine the country associated with a reply on various reddit threads on /r/europe subreddit using author's \"flair\" information. Some subreddits enable its users to select a \"flair\", which is a piece of information (usually a text, but can include iconography) that is displayed next to their usernames on each reply they submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of /r/europe, this information includes a flag and a piece of customizable text, that by default denotes their country, region or both (or neither) but can instead be customized to denote city or custom text entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of metadata, this information is represented in comment metadata by two fields:\n",
    "* `author_flair_css_class` denotes a custom country or region code, that is interpreted as a CSS class to display a flag icon. Examples of such codes are: `AMST`, `ASTR`, `AUST`, `BELG`, `BERM`, `BUCU` etc. While for some flair classes it's easy to infer the country that it represents with a manual review, it requires manual labour and there are cases where the flair class is not easily infered, such as `EART` (a flair for \"Earth\") and `FRNK` (a flair of Franconia, a region in the German state of Bavaria, which can be mistakenly confused with Frankfurt, a city in the neighbouring German state of Hesse).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `author_flair_text` denotes a custom text, that by default represents a predefined flair text that is usually the name of the correspoding country or region. However, this text that be entirely customized in a way that doesn't represent the usual meaning of `author_flair_css_class` at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is therefore consolidate all replies (with their flair metadata present) and create infer their country information from most common flair text information, with the assumption that most users on /r/europe don't customize their flair text information. This *will* require some manual review at the end, but should drastically improve analysis experience over manually and meticulously selecting and observing flair changes to author's own reddit profile, as this information is not present in flair selecting menu HTML source code due to obfustication."
